__Tron AI__
The goal of this project is to develop an AI based on a multilayer perceptron.
This AI aims to learn how to play Tron game in multiplayer and to play against it.

__Work done__
The game part is implemented, graphics use SDL2.
Parts of the backpropagation algorithm are implemented.
The player can play with keyboard input and his moves are fed to the neural network.
A random network can be created and control the player inputs.

__Work todo__
Finish and correct backprop algorithm.
Add multiples instances of players.
Add a genetic algorithm for learning alone.
Add other AI algorithm ?
